# redis_on_nanops
Redis on Windows is an open source key-value store that functions as a data structure server.

This repo is based on the work of  [micdenny](https://github.com/micdenny/docker-samples) and contains the Dockerfiles to build images that run a Redis server on a Powershell enabled Nanoserver.
